## Current State
Cancelled in prototype phase.  It was still a fantastic learning experience, as I experimented with Java FX and integrating Guice DI with FXML.  I liked FXML from an MVC perspective, as it forces you to have a proper controller for each view.  I'll keep this project around for future reference.
